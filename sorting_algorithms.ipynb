    "Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.  \n",
    "It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and places it at the correct position in the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps of Selection Sort:\n",
    "1. Start from the first element of the list.\n",
    "2. Find the smallest element from the unsorted portion.\n",
    "3. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n",
    "4. Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts one step forward.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2–4 until the entire list is sorted.\n",

    "Sorting `[29, 10, 14, 37, 13]` in ascending order:\n",

    "- **Pass 1:** Smallest is `10` → swap with `29` → `[10, 29, 14, 37, 13]`\n",
    "- **Pass 2:** Smallest from remaining is `13` → swap with `29` → `[10, 13, 14, 37, 29]`\n",
    "- **Pass 3:** Smallest from remaining is `14` → already in correct position → `[10, 13, 14, 37, 29]`\n",
